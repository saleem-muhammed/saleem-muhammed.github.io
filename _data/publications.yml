  year: 2025

  cats: ["multi-messenger"]
  summary: >-
    We investigate whether neutron star–black hole mergers and fast-merging binary neutron star systems can explain the observed r-process enrichment in the Milky Way. By combining gravitational-wave, gamma-ray burst, pulsar, and stellar abundance data, we show that these merger channels cannot by themselves account for the Galactic r-process budget, highlighting the need for additional, non-merger production pathways..

  summary: >-
    With a Mock-data challenge, we demonstrate the ability of template-based approach for the detection of stochastic gravitational wave background from binary black hole mergers: the method is three orders of magnitude more sensitive than any conventional approach, and promises the least waiting time to the first ever detection of the astrophysical background. We resolved a number of subtle noise characterization challenges that stands in the way of identifying the astrophysical background that burried deep in the detector noise.

  summary: >-
    We present a Principal Component Analysis–based framework for testing general relativity (GR) with gravitational-wave signals from compact binary coalescences. Using both simulated and real LIGO–Virgo events, we show that this multiparameter approach can robustly identify potential deviations from GR while accounting for physical effects such as orbital eccentricity, yielding results consistent with GR and demonstrating readiness for application to future observing runs.
