## Interests
- Tests of General Relativity and alternatives using GW observations  
- Nature of compact objects (black holes, neutron stars, and exotic compact objects)  
- Stochastic gravitational-wave background: detection and astrophysical interpretation  
- Multi-messenger synergies with GRBs and EM counterparts to GW events  
- Methods and pipelines: ML architectures for noise regression and Bayesian inference

## Current Themes
### Real-time Denoising for GW Detectors
Designing and deploying ML-based noise regression (DeepClean and coherence-guided variants) to improve detector data quality and downstream parameter estimation.

### Population Inference & GR Tests
Hierarchical constraints on spin-induced quadrupole moments, degeneracy-breaking across mass ratio and spin distributions, and robust population modeling.

### Stochastic Background from Stellar-mass BBHs
Mock-data challenges, sensitivity studies, and cross-correlation methodologies to approach a first detection during advanced observing runs.

### Multi-messenger Compact Object Physics
GRB/GW joint analyses, afterglow and energetics modeling, and constraints on BNS merger properties from EM counterparts.
