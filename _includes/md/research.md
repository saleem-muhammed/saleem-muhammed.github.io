## Research

I work on various aspects of gravitational-wave physics and astronomy. Broadly, my interests span four areas:

### Strong-field tests of gravity

Gravitational waves let us test **Einstein’s general relativity** in the most extreme conditions in the Universe—where objects move at **relativistic speeds** and gravity is **intensely strong**, such as the spacetime near a black-hole horizon. I use GW observations across entire event catalogs (and forecasts for next-generation detectors) to ask: *does gravity behave exactly as GR predicts in these regimes?*

I also explore the possibility that some systems we call “black holes” could instead be **exotic compact objects (ECOs)**—black-hole look-alikes with similar masses, spins, and compactness but a different underlying nature. My work looks for **tell-tale departures** in the waveforms and population properties that would either reinforce the black-hole picture or point to new physics.

In practice, this means building and applying tests that search for **small, coherent deviations** from GR and **signatures inconsistent with true black holes**, combining information from many events to reach decisive conclusions.

<h3>GW data analysis</h3>
<p>
In **precision gravitational-wave astronomy**, modeling the **detector noise** is as crucial as modeling the underlying physics—otherwise our inferences can be seriously biased. I work on understanding noise in GW interferometers and its impact on key science results, developing methods to **denoise data** and building **statistical models** that better capture the data’s non-idealities. I also design **AI-powered, real-time noise-regression** tools for interferometers to improve low-latency analyses and overall detector sensitivity.
