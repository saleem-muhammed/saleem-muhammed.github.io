## About

I’m Muhammed Saleem Cholayil, a Research Fellow at the Weinberg Institute for Theoretical Physics (University of Texas at Austin). My work uses gravitational-wave observations to address questions in fundamental physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. I focus on strong-field tests of general relativity, the stochastic gravitational-wave background, multi-messenger studies of compact objects, and advanced data-analysis techniques for GW experiments—particularly Bayesian inference and machine learning for population iference, noise characterization and low-latency pipelines.


Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Associate at the University of Minnesota, a Visiting Fellow at Chennai Mathematical Institute, after my graduate studies at Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Thiruvananthapuram. 

In this website, you will find more details about my work.
